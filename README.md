# covid-simulation
Object-oriented programming applications for COVID (in both Java and C++).

For this project, I put great emphasis on code readability, as I follow good coding practices such as: 
- meaningful commenting/documentation
- consistent indentation
- appropriate naming conventions
- and more.
