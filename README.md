Object-oriented programming applications for COVID-19.

### Purpose of Project

I started this project in Fall 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Back then, 
I was a novice at programming; I was only knowledgable in Java at the time.
Fast forward to 2023, I decided to revisit this project to do the following:
- [x] Add JUnit tests to ensure the overall functionality of `InfectionTracking.java`
- [x] Convert code from Java to C++ for certain files
- [x] Improve styling for code readability
- [x] Just for fun: experiment with C++ regex library
- [x] Just for fun: add C++ implementation of a Pushdown Automaton

**Technical Skills Used**: Java, JUnit, C++

### For this project, I practiced writing clean code:

- meaningful commenting/documentation
- consistent indentation
- appropriate naming conventions
- eliminated magic numbers
- and other good practices for writing code with great readability and purpose!
